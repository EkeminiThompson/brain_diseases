## Introduction
The Brain Disease Prediction System aims to improve the prediction and early diagnosis of brain diseases by integrating various data types. The system includes data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and visualization components to provide a holistic understanding of brain diseases.

## Features
- **Data Integration:** Combines genomic, clinical, imaging, biomarker, behavioral, and environmental data.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilizes Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Variational Autoencoders for prediction.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an interactive and easy-to-use interface for data input and prediction.
- **Visualization:** Displays prediction results in a user-friendly and readable format with explanations.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-disease-prediction.git
    cd brain-disease-prediction
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the database:**
    ```bash
    flask db init
    flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
    flask db upgrade
    ```

## Usage
1. **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

2. **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3. **Navigate through the application:**
    - **Home Page:** Overview of the system and data shapes.
    - **Train Models:** Train machine learning models using integrated data.
    - **Predict:** Enter data for prediction and view results.
